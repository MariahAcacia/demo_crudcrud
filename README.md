demo_crudcrud
=============

An ad-hoc demo of building a full Rails CRUD app in 45 minutes which quickly became our go-to playground for testing out new concepts and exploring code.  You should download it and play with all the functionality it represents... it is quite dirty and informal and you can always re-clone it if you break it.

Running it:

```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

See the `db/seeds.rb` file for default user passwords and naming conventions.
